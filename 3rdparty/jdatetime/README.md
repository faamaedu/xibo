##About v2.2.0

PHP's default `date` function does not support years higher than 2038, so the `DateTime` class was introduced in PHP5 to solve this problem and provide more sophisticated date methods. Iranian users have been using an old `jdate` function to convert Gregorian date to the Jalali equivalent, which is completely based on the old php `date` function so its pretty much out-dated.
